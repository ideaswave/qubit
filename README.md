# Quantum-Inspired Circuit and Workflow Automation Engine

This project is a **multi-platform automation engine** that integrates **quantum circuit orchestration**, **process automation (BPMN, DMN, CMMN)**, and **enterprise integration (Apache Camel)** capabilities. Designed to support diverse environments—including **servers**, **mobile devices**, and **edge microprocessors**—the engine enables **dynamic workflows** and **quantum-inspired decision-making** for modern automation.

## **Features**

### **1. Quantum Circuit Execution**
- Supports quantum gate operations such as **Hadamard**, **CNOT**, **Phase Shift**, and **Controlled Gates**.
- Handles **entangled qubit states** and dynamic execution paths.

### **2. Dynamic Route and Workflow Management**
- Inspired by **Apache Camel DSL**, supporting complex route definitions.
- Enables features like **multicast**, **wire taps**, **conditional branching**, and **exception handling**.

### **3. Process Mapping and Optimization**
- YAML-based mappers allow dynamic input-output mapping for complex workflows.
- Circuit execution can be optimized using **quantum-inspired algorithms**.

### **4. RESTful API Integration**
- REST endpoints for real-time circuit execution, state manipulation, and monitoring.
- Debugging tools include **WebSocket-based live qubit state monitoring**.

### **5. Cross-Platform Support**
- Deploy on **cloud servers**, **mobile devices**, and **edge microprocessors**.
- Provides lightweight configurations suitable for **IoT environments**.

## **Example Use Cases**

### **Logistics Optimization**
Use quantum circuits to optimize delivery routes, reduce costs, and allocate capacity efficiently.
```yaml
inputMapping:
  fields:
    - name: "routeId"
      type: "string"
      mapTo: "routeQubit.id"
    - name: "distance"
      type: "float"
      mapTo: "routeQubit.distance"
```

### **Enterprise Workflow Automation**
Define and execute workflows with route-based logic.
```yaml
routes:
  - id: "StartProcessing"
    from: "direct:startProcessing"
    steps:
      - to: "direct:validateInput"
      - to: "direct:applyCostOracle"
```

### **Quantum Experimentation**
Run simulations of **quantum-inspired algorithms** to explore research and development opportunities.
